# virtualmin-tools
Tools to extend Virtualmin for easing migration from cPanel/WHM

## syncNginxProxy.pl
This tool is designed to be run every time Virtualmin modifies or creates a server in order to keep NGINX updated as a reverse proxy. It can also be run manually to recreate one or all proxy records for NGINX.
